# How to RugPull memecoin in PumpFun.

[My RugPull Community](https://t.me/rugpulldotcom)

Most likely you have noticed different videos from different bloggers, I don't want you to watch them and take unnecessary information. Because everyone wants to profit from you.

1. do not buy left bots
2. do not go to sites with ragpools and do not connect your wallets

- This YouTuber and this site with such subscriptions have no exact relation to ragpools, they give out information that everyone knows.
  
**Step 1 (bots)**
- [PumpKing Bundler](https://t.me/PumpKingBundlerBot?start=qoTpAI) - The first launch is free but there is no point in it, you can't buy through buy wallets. Subscription for a week 1 sol price

- [PumpFun Bundler](https://t.me/PumpFunBundlerBot?start=ref-JBLSX) - Launches below 2.5 SOL have no commission. From 2.5 SOL the commission starts at 7.5% and eventually decreases to ~3.65%

- [Deploy On Vortex](https://t.me/DeployOnVortexBot?start=vrtxmode) - New to the bundle market <-- Best at the moment 0,8% fee  (without ref - 1,5% fee)

- [Trench Bot](https://trench.bot/) Conveniently track your first cats and total supply

- [ChartUp Volume Booster](https://t.me/chartup_bot?start=Z84IZL) To scroll through the volume, choose a subscription by budget

- [PumpFun Bumper](https://t.me/ChipperBumpBot?start=ref-JBLSX) for 0.1 sol you will stand on the main screen on pump.fun 

**Step 2 (calculations)**

1. Fill from wallet Dev maximum 10 sol and no more!
2. When replenishing wallets for purchase, distribute different amounts and percentages. Total 15 sol = 20 wallets = 15 sol = 1.33 sol total all wallets. The calculation is approximate, you do not have to transfer 1.33 sol to each wallet, you can send 2 sol to 1 wallet and 0.5 sol to another and so on up to 15 sol.

   *Examples of how not to launch your bundles at the beginning*

  *Calculation: You can launch from the dev wallet for 2-5 sol then buy back from your own wallets, you can sell the entire amount from the dev and immediately buy back without a bundle with live purchases. Screenshot below*

> Every fool can launch his own bundle and there are a lot of such fools, but only a few earn using rugs.
> You don't need to just launch your bundle coin and it will stupidly go up, but you won't earn anything from it.

- Any flipper can see right away when it's rag and when it's not. For this purpose, you need to mix it with live purchases at the beginning of the bundle.

*Below are 3 screenshots and 3 examples of what is a good bundle and what is not*

                              - Option 1 is a bad bundle
![57f96f7f-b68a-424b-9ef0-38c3b1d8849e](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a54480b-ea20-47b4-8a6c-422b210ebc4c)

                              - Option 2 is a good bundle
![d15c1fe4-75cb-481c-826e-4eb4cd5eeef0](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3b26b7a5-65d4-4c46-8ad1-3c3aa53935ee)

- I think you can see the difference in the 2 graphs, the first bundle is very trivial and rarely works, and the second bundle works great 90%.

                              - 3rd version of the bundle that I use in 60% of my rugs
![a90ba32f-7843-4485-bed7-5bae698fa35a](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f285d687-00a0-448b-871d-5efdb67b2b09)

*for the 3rd option, you need to very quickly go under the meta and very quickly issue transactions for the bundle, that is, you launched the bundle, made live purchases, but at the same time, you have an interval before purchases of 2-3 minutes. This should not be, you must make fast volumes at launch, that is, when you just launched and your purchases are in progress, in such bundles you will not have time to hesitate.*

1. An outdated type of bundle, such as rug are used to farm hamsters who want to learn rug, such bundle launches do not bring income but only losses in minus fee
2. An ideal option for any meta, just launch for the meta and not necessarily high money for such launches, on such bundle launches it is very easy to manipulate beautifully on the chart
3. This bundle is suitable only for quick shooters who will have time to create a token for the news, meta or for some event. This bundle advantage is that you artificially create hype and a sharp volume of token, that is, the last 2 bundles they go slowly, and on this one you do everything at speed and other people seeing the pump start to fly in for free

**GOOD BANK**

*Basic strategy of draining all tokens from dev and buy from different wallets actively for good amounts*
